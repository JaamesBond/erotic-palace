# erotic-palace
This project aims to achieve the network, database, web app and API design for the Erotic Palace

Here, I will walk you step-by-step through my journey.

First of all, I had to virtualize the whole network, so I chose a RaspberryPi 5 for this. I installed VMWare ESXi, I configured the network and storage. After that, I created a Ubuntu server VM and installed nginx to be able to run flask. I will tun you through this process in a different file, to keep this clean.
